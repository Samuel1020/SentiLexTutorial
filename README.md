# SentiLexTutorial
Sentiment lexicon creation tutorial for the UCREL summer school. 

This is based on the the sentiment lexicon creation defined in this [paper](http://aclweb.org/anthology/D16-1057) and uses the code from that paper as well which can be found [here](https://github.com/williamleif/socialsent), we actually manipulated the original code so that it is compatiable with python3 that code can be found [here](https://github.com/apmoore1/socialsent).

The tutorial is within the [IPython notebook]()

The code requires the following [PIPs](requirements.txt). To install them run the following:
`pip3 install -r requirements.txt`
